	select WIRELESS_EXT
	select WEXT_SPY
	select WEXT_PRIV
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an Aviator/Raytheon PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.
	  Please read the file <file:Documentation/networking/ray_cs.txt> for
	  details.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called ray_cs.  If unsure, say N.

	tristate "Planet WL3501 PCMCIA cards"
	depends on CFG80211 && PCMCIA
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	select WEXT_SPY
	help
	  A driver for WL3501 PCMCIA 802.11 wireless cards made by Planet.
	  It has basic support for Linux wireless extensions and initial
	  micro support for ethtool.

config MAC80211_HWSIM
	tristate "Simulated radio testing tool for mac80211"
	depends on MAC80211
	---help---
	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test
	  IEEE 802.11 networking stack (mac80211) functionality. This is not
	  needed for normal wireless LAN usage and is only for testing. See
	  Documentation/networking/mac80211_hwsim for more information on how
	  to use this tool.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mac80211_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.

config USB_NET_RNDIS_WLAN

	depends on USB
	depends on CFG80211
	select USB_NET_DRIVERS
	select USB_USBNET
	select USB_NET_CDCETHER
	select USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST
	---help---
	  This is a driver for wireless RNDIS devices.
	  These are USB based adapters found in devices such as:

	  Buffalo WLI-U2-KG125S
	  U.S. Robotics USR5421
	  Belkin F5D7051
	  Linksys WUSB54GSv2
	  Linksys WUSB54GSC
	  Asus WL169gE
	  Eminent EM4045
	  BT Voyager 1055
	  Linksys WUSB54GSv1
	  U.S. Robotics USR5420
	  BUFFALO WLI-USB-G54

	  All of these devices are based on Broadcom 4320 chip which is the
	  only wireless RNDIS chip known to date.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called rndis_wlan.

config ADM8211
	tristate "ADMtek ADM8211 support"
	depends on MAC80211 && PCI
	select CRC32
	select EEPROM_93CX6
	---help---
	  This driver is for ADM8211A, ADM8211B, and ADM8211C based cards.
	  These are PCI/mini-PCI/Cardbus 802.11b chips found in cards such as:

	  Xterasys Cardbus XN-2411b
	  Blitz NetWave Point PC
	  TrendNet 221pc
	  Belkin F5D6001
	  SMC 2635W
	  Linksys WPC11 v1
	  Fiberline FL-WL-200X
	  3com Office Connect (3CRSHPW796)
	  Corega WLPCIB-11
	  SMC 2602W V2 EU
	  D-Link DWL-520 Revision C

	  However, some of these cards have been replaced with other chips
	  like the RTL8180L (Xterasys Cardbus XN-2411b, Belkin F5D6001) or
	  the Ralink RT2400 (SMC2635W) without a model number change.

	  Thanks to Infineon-ADMtek for their support of this driver.
